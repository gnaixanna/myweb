<h1>Why did he choose Dirac?</h1>

<p>Did Ehrenfest understand that Dirac understood his struggle, because Dirac's brother left in the same way? Did he understand that Dirac's silence was due to his own struggle under Charles's education? If he didn't understand, then the logic of "he chose to confide in someone who couldn't understand him" was valid, because this was considered from his perspective. Based on the fact that Ehrenfest and Dirac had always been friends, would he understand that Dirac understood? But at the same time, Dirac was unwilling to mention his past stories.</p>
<p>If he knew that Dirac understood, why did he still look for him? Maybe because he wanted Dirac to "resonate in silence"? But I don't think he would do that, because any attempt to understand would make him more painful. (Even if speculating on the reasons behind the other party's silence would make him very uncomfortable, Ehrenfest might do so, based on his emotionality at this moment)</p>
<p>Why didn't Ehrenfest tell Bohr? He didn't even send the suicide note. If it was because Bohr represented the physical world that made him suffer, then Dirac was more rational and represented the rebirth of quantum physics. Isn't he more of a representative of the world that Ehrenfest wants to escape from? Or is Dirac not in the "power" structure? If it's because Bohr will try to understand him... does he really think that Dirac won't understand him, even in silence? We are back to this question.</p>
<p>Is it because he is weighing between "trying to understand vocally" and "trying to understand silently with probability", or between "trying to understand" and "not understanding"? (Well... I tend to lean towards the former)</p>
<p>A step back. Maybe he doesn't know that Dirac knows, he just needs the recognition of the successful people in the society that makes him suffer. Then doing this with him is because he needs to tell Dirac these things because Dirac will not be affected... Can these two motivations not exist at the same time? Maybe both of them are his motivations, maybe the "telling to the silent person" is not because he wants to leave, but to stay. So they are self-consistent. In this way, Ehrenfest seems to be eager for his identity to be understood and recognized, but afraid that his emotions and such hopes will be tried to be understood and judged by others.</p>
<p>Or maybe it was just because Dirac had clumsily (sincerely, after all, Dirac could not lie) praised him at the meeting at Bohr's house. Would Ehrenfest really have rationally weighed the pros and cons at that time?</p>
