<p>He felt sad, just like he cried when he learned of Einstein's death. He felt pain, just like Ehrenfest's self-blame when he left. He looked up at the sky and found that the clouds and fog moved slowly and introvertedly like himself. He felt love from his first love, Margaret, who was called "Mickey Mouse". Margaret was like the parrot standing on his shoulder in the zoo: he smiled. But he dreamed painfully in it, and it was also because of love. He and Margaret were shrouded in the nightmare of the disappearance of his stepdaughter. His mind was opened, bringing him pain or joy in ways that others did not know, just like when Pauli criticized him and Heisenberg mercilessly, and like Pauli's later changes. Just like Felix's choice: it seemed that it was his own life, independent of Dirac. Later, he told others about love in his own way, even if he didn't know how they would respond, and didn't know how it would change them, just like he told his granddaughter: "You look like Cher." In the process of people constantly flowing, he gradually saw himself in his own world.</p>
<p>He also said, "My worst decision was marrying a woman who wanted to leave home." That's not regret or blame... I don't know how to analyze this sentence, the only thing I can say is "It's a child's statement of fact, like "My friend left" and "I knocked over the jar", but I wonder if it's not neutral enough, whether it's a quibble.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think this is what each of us does.</p>
