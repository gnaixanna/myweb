    <p>Paul Dirac has influenced me more than anyone else. He influenced me in two ways: his pursuit of pure logic made me reflect on the essence of beauty, and his tranquility after tragedy made me think deeply about the balance of logic and impulsion in understanding and relationships. Dirac's experience inspired me to write short fiction and analytical articles that display the relationships of the figures in early quantum theory. In researching the historical sources for composing those articles, I feel the realistic fullness of those historical figures rather than a shallow conclusion of their characteristics, such as "an indifferent genius". This made me rethink their logical and illogical behaviours that hide behind those stories, their incompleteness as perfection, in other words, completeness as a human.</p>
