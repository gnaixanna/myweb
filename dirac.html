    <p>Paul Dirac has influenced me more than anyone else. He influenced me in two ways: his pursuit of pure logic made me reflect on the essence of beauty, and his tranquility after tragedy made me think deeply about the balance of logic and impulsion in understanding and relationships. Dirac's experience inspired me to write short fiction and analytical articles that display the relationships of the figures in early quantum theory. In researching the historical sources for composing those articles, I feel the realistic fullness of those historical figures rather than a shallow conclusion of their characteristics, such as "an indifferent genius". This made me rethink their logical and illogical behaviours that hide behind those stories, their incompleteness as perfection, in other words, completeness as a human.</p>

    <p>A man not larger than life, but exactly life-sized. In it, he awkwardly coexisted with emotions that he called "insignificant", as if even sadness is a sacred thing that is not allowed.</p>
    <p>He sat almost in the middle of a quiet wheat field, minimizing disturbances as much as possible, but the golden color seemed to be suppressed painfully, and no one knew whether it was because the deep blue sky was getting lower or because the crows stopped coming.</p>
    <p>I typed this in a letter format and I was too lazy to change it:</p>
    <p>To Dirac: </p>
<p>In the face of a huge tragedy, any words of love and kindness seem to be useless. No matter how these emotions are expressed: whether they are said by people who are good at expressing themselves, or displayed in a blunt but sincere way. They seem to be unable to change a certain ending, so this makes people to regret that they were not able to say what they originally wanted to say (or perhaps this was also not what they originally wanted to say, but just another possibility), even if they themselves may rationally know that it would not make any difference to the tragic ending, but the existence of a possibility makes them regret, because they can no longer go back to the past: "If I was silent at that time? If I was more impulsive at that time?".</p>

<p>This does not seem to mean that love is not important, or totally useless . Perhaps human nature itself comes from the impulse to retain the others , even if this impulse is so small, or perhaps it is suppressed by the way of protecting oneself that one has been familiar with for a long time, such as rationality, even if this impulse is expressed in different ways by different people, even if this impulse did not stop the other person from leaving along the river in the end anyway . So I think that impulse and rationality are not contradictory, because love is buried between them. Whether there is more rationality or more impulse, it does not mean whether love is shallower or deeper. It's just that people have different habits. Even like you, you were used to protect yourself with logic. Even when Ehrenfest confided his feelings after the meeting at Bohr&apos;s house, you told yourself the "best way to respond" in a linguistic way, and deduced the conclusion that "Ehrenfest seems to be fine in the short term." Were you really not good at reading the other meaning from the words, such as "Ehrenfest is depressed and he may have dangerous tendencies", or did you suppress this idea and actively ignore this hint? This led you to act as if you was not responding to pain - but you did so because you didn&apos;t know whether your response would make things worse, it’s just that you found the optimal solution in your own structure. This is not not loving others, but people&apos;s expressions are too different, and there are too many misunderstandings.</p>

<p>But after doing this, you still felt regretful and even blamed yourself. Didn&apos;t you understand that even if you told Bohr about Ehrenfest&apos;s situation at the time, it would not change the outcome? Perhaps this regret is because no one can really "not respond" to other people&apos;s emotional expressions. This is the embodiment of love, which struggles between impulse, rationality, and "perhaps unchangeable" results. Some say that Ehrenfest confided in you because he thought you would not respond or try to understand him, so you was a safe person to confide in. Although we cannot know what Ehrenfest thought, this letter tells us that you were definitely not "not responding, not trying to understand", and silence does not mean not hearing. Then you withdrew again, as if questioning whether you had exaggerated some trivial things. This is a very heartbreaking performance. I originally wanted to explain this matter in conjunction with your childhood experience, but then I thought that maybe it was not true, but exaggerating the fact. In fact, I am not sure which part, nature or childhood experience, has accounted for a higher proportion in the process of building your character. Maybe this was just you using logic to suppress emotions again.</p>

<p>But I think you never regarded it as a trivial thing, after all, you remembered what Ehrenfest said so clearly.</p>
